==================

1. Clone the repository to get php-sdk folder having index.php file, examples and payzippy-sdk folders. 

2. To use the sample code, copy the payzippy files & directories to a directory of your choice. It can be server's document root of you web server. (i.e. where your current php files, for your website, are stored)

3. Open php-sdk/payzippy-sdk/Config.php file and set up your config details such as Merchant ID, Secret Key, Callback URL. The examples won't work without setting up the config details. You can also set the UI mode to redirect or iframe (details in point 6).
